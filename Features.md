# AIXcel Features

## âœ… Currently Implemented

### Core Spreadsheet Engine

**Feature: Excel Formula Engine**
- **What it does**: Evaluates Excel-style formulas (=SUM, =AVERAGE, etc.) and cell references (A1, B2, etc.)
- **How it works**: Uses the `evalexpr` crate to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions, with custom functions for SUM and AVERAGE. Cell references are resolved by querying the SQLite database.

**Feature: Real-time Collaboration**
- **What it does**: Multiple users can edit the same spreadsheet simultaneously with real-time updates
- **How it works**: WebSocket connections broadcast cell updates to all connected clients. Each user gets a unique session ID and changes are propagated instantly.

**Feature: SQLite Data Persistence**
- **What it does**: Stores spreadsheet data persistently with cell formatting (font weight, style, background color)
- **How it works**: SQLite database with a `cells` table storing row, column, value, and formatting information with UPSERT operations for efficient updates.

**Feature: Responsive Web Interface**
- **What it does**: Modern Next.js frontend with virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **How it works**: React-based grid component with dynamic rendering, cell selection, context menus, and real-time WebSocket integration.

**Feature: REST API**
- **What it does**: HTTP endpoints for cell operations, formula evaluation, and bulk operations
- **How it works**: Actix-web server with CORS support providing endpoints for `/cells`, `/evaluate`, `/cells/bulk`, and `/cells/clear`.

### Performance & Scalability

**Feature: Virtual Grid Rendering**
- **What it does**: Handles large datasets efficiently by only rendering visible cells
- **How it works**: Calculates visible area based on viewport and scroll position, only rendering cells within the visible bounds plus a buffer.

**Feature: Bulk Operations**
- **What it does**: Efficiently handles multiple cell updates in a single transaction
- **How it works**: Database transactions for bulk inserts/updates and WebSocket batch notifications.
